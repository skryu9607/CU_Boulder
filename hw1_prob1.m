% Problem 3. You are given :
% 1. An aircraft inertial velocity in body coordinates.
% 2. The a/cs air relative velocity in the wind frame. 
% 3. The velocity of the wind in the inertial frame.
% Further, you are given. 
% 4. The rotation matrix from the wind frame to the body frame.
% 5. The rotation matrix from the body frame to the inertial frame.
% State the correct vector or matrix notation for each term, and then 
% write a single equation that relates them all.
